## 1. Project Overview

### What is TimeTide?

TimeTide is a modern, self-hostable scheduling platform that enables users to share their availability and let others book time with them. It provides individual and team scheduling with deep calendar integration, video conferencing, webhooks, analytics, and a tiered plan system.

| **Educators & Coaches** | Tutoring, mentorship, office hours |
| **Healthcare Providers** | Patient consultations (non-clinical) |
| **Recruiters** | Interview scheduling, screenings |

### Core Use Cases

1. **Event Type Creation** - Define bookable meeting templates with custom settings
2. **Availability Sharing** - Set weekly hours and share public booking pages
3. **Booking Management** - Receive, confirm, reschedule, or cancel appointments
4. **Calendar Synchronization** - Two-way sync with Google Calendar and Outlook
5. **Team Scheduling** - Round-robin, collective, and managed team scheduling
6. **Video Conferencing** - Auto-generate Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams links
7. **Recurring Bookings** - Weekly, biweekly, monthly recurring meetings

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

### Auth Flow

```
OAuth (Google):
  Click Login → Google Redirect → Callback → Create/Link Account → JWT Cookie

Credentials:
  Email + Password → Zod Validate → bcrypt Verify → JWT Cookie

Signup:
  Validate → Check Existing → Hash Password → Create User →
  Generate Username → Default Schedule → Default Event → Verify Email
```

### Session Structure

```typescript
interface Session {
  user: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    name?: string;
    image?: string;
    username?: string;
    timezone: string;
    plan: UserPlan;       // FREE | PRO | TEAM
    onboardingCompleted: boolean;
  }
}
```

### Route Protection (middleware.ts)

**Protected (require auth):**
- `/dashboard/*` - All dashboard pages
- `/api/availability/*`, `/api/event-types/*`, `/api/users/me`, `/api/webhooks/*`, `/api/teams/*`, `/api/calendars/*`

**Public:**
- `/` - Landing page
- `/auth/*` - Auth pages
- `/[username]/*` - Public booking pages
- `/team/*` - Public team pages
- `/api/auth/*`, `/api/slots`, `/api/bookings` (POST), `/api/public/*`

**Additional checks:**
- Unverified email → redirect to `/auth/verify-email-required`
- Onboarding incomplete → redirect to `/dashboard/onboarding`

### Team Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **OWNER** | Full team control, delete team, manage all |
| **ADMIN** | Manage settings, members, event types |
| **MEMBER** | View team, participate in scheduling |

## 6. Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 16+
- Redis 7+ (optional, for job queue)

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/timetide-app.git
cd timetide-app
npm install
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d          # Start PostgreSQL + Redis
npm run db:generate           # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:migrate            # Run migrations
npm run dev                   # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
```

### Required Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/timetide?schema=public"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="openssl-rand-base64-32"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### Optional Environment Variables

```env
# Email
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_api_key"
EMAIL_FROM="TimeTide <noreply@yourdomain.com>"

# Redis
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# Zoom
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="your-zoom-client-id"
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="your-zoom-client-secret"

# Microsoft
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID="your-azure-app-id"
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET="your-azure-client-secret"
MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID="common"
```

### Development Scripts

```bash
npm run dev            # Development server
npm run build          # Production build
npm run lint           # ESLint
npm run db:generate    # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:migrate     # Run migrations
npm run db:push        # Push schema (dev only)
npm run db:studio      # Prisma Studio GUI
npm run db:seed        # Seed database
npm run test           # Unit tests (Vitest)
npm run test:e2e       # E2E tests (Playwright)
```

### Docker Development

```bash
docker-compose up -d       # Start PostgreSQL + Redis
docker-compose down        # Stop
docker-compose down -v     # Stop + delete volumes
docker-compose logs -f     # View logs
```

---

## 7. Key Implementation Details

### Slot Calculation Safety Limits

```typescript
MAX_SLOTS_PER_DAY = 100;     // Prevents memory explosion
MAX_DAYS_TO_PROCESS = 90;    // Limits calculation scope
MIN_SLOT_INTERVAL = 5;       // Minimum 5 minutes between slots
```

### Double-Booking Prevention

Slot availability checks ALL host bookings across ALL event types, not just the current one. Calendar busy times are fetched in real-time. Final validation occurs at booking creation.

### Plan Limits Configuration

Defined in `src/lib/pricing.ts` as `PLAN_LIMITS` object. Two enforcement layers:
- **Server**: `checkNumericLimit()` and `checkFeatureAccess()` in API routes
- **Client**: `useFeatureGate()` hook with ProBadge, UpgradeModal, FeatureGatePage components

### Webhook Security

- HMAC-SHA256 signature in `X-Webhook-Signature` header
- Secret auto-generated (32 bytes hex) on webhook creation
- Signature format: `sha256=<hex_digest>`

### Background Jobs

BullMQ queues with Redis backend. Initialized in `src/instrumentation.ts`. Fallback to direct execution when Redis is unavailable.

### Prisma Client

Generated to `src/generated/prisma/` (configured in `prisma.config.ts`). Path alias: `@/generated/prisma`.

## 8. Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Performance

| Issue | Impact | Suggested Fix |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Slot calculation on every request | Medium | Add Redis caching with TTL |
| Sequential calendar API calls | Medium | Parallelize multi-calendar fetches |
| Multiple analytics DB queries | Low | Consolidate into single aggregation |

### Security

| Issue | Risk | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| In-memory rate limiting resets on restart | Low | Use Redis in production |
| OAuth tokens stored as plain text | Medium | Consider field-level encryption |

### Code Quality

| Area | Issue |
|------|-------|
| API Routes | Inconsistent error response formats |
| Types | Some API response types are inline rather than shared |
| Testing | Limited test coverage (slots + validation have tests) |
| Logging | Console-only, no structured logging |
| Monitoring | No health checks or APM |

---

## 9. Future Improvements

### High Priority

|---------|-------------|
| **Stripe Integration** | Payment processing for paid bookings |
| **Structured Logging** | Replace console.log with LogTail/similar |
| **Health Checks** | Endpoint for infrastructure monitoring |
| **Test Coverage** | Expand unit and integration tests |

### Medium Priority

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Apple Calendar** | CalDAV integration |
| **SMS Notifications** | Twilio integration |
| **Custom Domains** | User-specific booking domains |
| **i18n** | Internationalization support |
| **API Versioning** | `/api/v1/` prefix |

### Nice to Have
